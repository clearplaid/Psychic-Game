# Psychic-Game
This project is a guess the letter type game.

The user is told to "Guess the letter that I am thinking"
The user should input letters on the keyboard to make their guess
The letter will be put on the screen and the user will either win and the game will reset to guess another letter or
the user will continue to guess until they have no more remaining guesses. 
In this case, the user will lose and the losses counter will increase while the rest of the game resets to play again.
